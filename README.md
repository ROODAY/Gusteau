# Gusteau
The ultimate pantry inventory, grocery list, and recipe finder

# Planned Features
## Pantry Inventory
- Track both ingredients used in recipes (onions, salt, chicken, etc.) and items that can just be eaten (poptarts, microwave meals, etc).
- Track amount (optional) i.e. number of poptarts left, approximate amount of flour left, etc. Notifications when amount is low.
- Populate inventory with receipt scanner, barcode scanner, and manually.
- Track expiry of items and get notified when things are close to/past expiry.
- Allow multiple users to collaborate (concept of homes/users that live together).

## Grocery List
- Populate from inventory (e.g. when expired/low amount), from recipes, or manually.
- Integrate with splitwise and/or venmo.
- Allow multiple users to collaborate (concept of homes/users that live together).

## Recipe Finder
- Search multiple websites for recipes.
- Search by cuisine.
- Search by owned ingedients (allow missing a couple ingredients and add to grocery list).
- Substitute ingredients (say soy milk for real milk, etc.).
- Integrate with online stores to order immediately.
- Allow user uploaded recipes.
- Recommend recipes based on previous choices, what people nearby are cooking, etc.
- Option to try new dishes than in the past using same ingredients.
- Say how many people are eating and ingredients count is auto-adjusted.
- Option to optimize to finish up ingredients before moving on to next to free up shelf/fridge space.
- Plan recipes between shopping dates (down to a meal for a specific calendar day). Optimize by searching for recipes that use similar ingredients so you can plan to buy in bulk to save money and have recipes ready to use up that stuff (if we can integrate with a store, could plan that recipes x y z and will exactly use up your ingredients you buy on data A and last till date B for next trip)
