# Gusteau

- Track both ingredients used in recipes (onions, salt, chicken, etc.) and items that can just be eaten (poptarts, microwave meals, etc).
- Track amount (optional) i.e. number of poptarts left, approximate amount of flour left, etc. Notifications when amount is low.
- Populate inventory with receipt scanner, barcode scanner, and manually.
- Track expiry of items and get notified when things are close to/past expiry.
- Allow multiple users to collaborate (concept of homes/users that live together).

## Grocery List
- Populate from inventory (e.g. when expired/low amount), from recipes, or manually.
- Integrate with splitwise and/or venmo.
